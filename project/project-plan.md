# Project Plan

## Title
Climate Change MADE Project

## Main Question
 How do changes in CO2 emissions affect global temperature anomalies?


## Description
This project investigates the relationship between global temperature anomalies and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions using NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP) and the Our World in Data CO2 dataset. By providing insights into the influence of human activities on climate change, the findings will help inform strategies for mitigating global warming and guide policymakers, researchers, and the public in addressing climate challenges.

## Datasources


### Datasource1: NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP)
* Metadata URL: https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/
* Data URL: https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/GLB.Ts+dSST.csv
* Data Type: CSV

* This data set addresses the problem of global surface temperature measurement and analysis. It provides a comprehensive record of temperature anomalies over time, which is crucial for understanding trends in global warming and climate change.

 ### Datasource2: Our World in Data CO2 dataset
* Metadata URL:https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions
* Data URL: https://github.com/owid/co2-data/raw/master/owid-co2-data.csv
* Data Type: CSV

* This data set addresses the problem of tracking global carbon dioxide emissions. It provides detailed records of CO2 emissions from different countries and regions, which is critical for understanding the sources of greenhouse gases contributing to climate change.
